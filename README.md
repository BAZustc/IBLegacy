#  White Whale front end  
The white whale front end is a mobile-first web application designed to be cross-compatible across platforms to provide access to the White Whale Protocol and join the quest to maintain the UST Peg!

## Installation  
Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:White-Whale-Defi-Platform/frontend.git
cd frontend
```

Setup the dependancies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the project as a webapp with livereload

```bash
npx ionic serve
```

## Architecture
The WhiteWhale front end app is compatible and responsive with mobile or desktop browsers. The apps codebase uses the (Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) combined with some [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and all of this is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
Its also possible to deploy the app to Android or iOS.

The webapp is designed such that you would need any special pre-setup scripts or env vars. Just get the project and serve it.
